# node_restAPI
NodeJs, Express, MongoDb, CRUD RestAPI

1. We will be building a RESTful CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) API with Node.js, Express and MongoDB.
2. Express is one of the most popular web frameworks for node.js. It is built on top of node.js http module, and adds support for routing, middleware, view system etc.
It is very simple and minimal, unlike other frameworks.
3. Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapping) tool for Node.js and MongoDB. It helps you convert the objects in your code to documents in the database and vice versa.

Please install MongoDB in your machine if you have not done already and Node as well.
 Application:
 We will be building a simple Note-Taking application. We will build Rest APIs for creating, listing, editing and deleting a Note.
 Finally, weâ€™ll test our REST APIs using Postman.
